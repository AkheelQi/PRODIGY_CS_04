Creating a keylogger involves capturing keystrokes and saving them to a file. However,
itâ€™s important to emphasize that keyloggers can be used maliciously, 
so they should only be developed and used with explicit permission and for ethical purposes, 
such as security testing or personal use on your own devices.


This script will log all keystrokes to a file named keylog.txt. 
The keylogger will stop when the Esc key is pressed.
